# 💖 Valentine's Surprise Proposal Website

A beautiful, interactive, single-page web application designed to ask that special someone: *"Will you be my Valentine?"* This project features a playful "No" button that runs away, a secret reveal, and a romantic photo transition gallery that only appears once they say **YES!**

## ✨ Features

* **Playful Interaction:** The "No" button teleports randomly when hovered over, making it "impossible" to reject the proposal.
* **Surprise Reveal:** The photo frame and Valentine's wishes are hidden initially and only reveal themselves with a smooth transition after the "Yes" button is clicked.
* **Awesome CSS Design:** Modern Glassmorphism UI with soft gradients and a blur effect.
* **Background Magic:** A continuous flow of floating hearts creates a romantic atmosphere.
* **Music Support:** A dedicated music toggle button for a romantic background track.
* **Responsive:** Works beautifully on both mobile and desktop screens.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5** - Structure and semantic content.
